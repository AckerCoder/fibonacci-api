# Fibonacci API

There is a need for a Rest (or Rest-like) API that can receive an index "n" and returns the Fibonacci value that corresponds to the given index, and you have been tasked with implementing the first version of this API.

## Instructions

Run the project and execute the route "localhost:8000/fibonacci". Here you can get all the fibonacci numbers adding the index param. For example:

* localhost:8000/fibonacci/6 will send 8.
* localhost:8000/fibonacci/3 will send 2.
* And so on...

### Dependencies

* Node
* Yarn
* Nodemon
* Express
* Windows

### Installing

* Download the main branch.
* Install the dependecies with "yarn install".
* That's all :)

### Executing program

* Open the project file with your favorite prompt.
* Execute;
```
node src
```

## Routes
We decided to set the fibonacci functionality in its respectivly route and not in the index one just in case we want to add more functionalities to the project in the future.
